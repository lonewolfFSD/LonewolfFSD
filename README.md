## What I’m About

- **Emotional Tech**: I believe AI should be more than functional—it should feel human. Lyra’s my proof, evolving with users through empathy and creativity.
- **Community First**: I’m active on **X (@lonewolffsd)**, **Discord**, and **Reddit**, hosting coding challenges and collaborating with devs worldwide.
- **Playful Aesthetic**: My work, like LyraLabs’ rose-tinted landing page, blends dreamy visuals with cutting-edge tech for experiences that pop.
- **Lifelong Learner**: I’m always diving into new stacks—currently exploring **WebAssembly** and **offline AI** to push Lyra’s boundaries.

## Current Projects

- **LyraLabs**: Leading the charge on Lyra, with upcoming features like voice-to-voice chats, offline mode, and a developer API.
- **Open-Source Tools**: Building libraries for emotional AI and sharing React components for interactive UIs.
- **Mentorship**: Kicking off a program to guide young coders, with hackathons planned for 2025.

## Fun Facts

- **Sci-Fi Nerd**: Inspired by *Her* and *Mass Effect*, I dream of AI that’s as relatable as a best friend.
- **Music Buff**: LyraTunes reflects my love for curating playlists—expect indie rock and lo-fi vibes.
- **Coffee Connoisseur**: Fueled by espresso, I code best with a cup in hand and a sunset view.
